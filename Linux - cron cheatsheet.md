[Crontab Explained in Linux \[With Examples\]](https://linuxhandbook.com/crontab/)

## How to Add/Update Crontab

Crontab files are typically stored in the /etc/cron.d/ directory on Linux systems. The crontab command can be used to edit the crontab file.

I recommend keeping a backup of all jobs entry in a file. This will help you to recover cron in case of accidental deletion.

```
crontab -l 
```

**Backup cron to text file:**

crontab -l > cron-backup.txt
cat cron-backup.txt
MAIL=rahul

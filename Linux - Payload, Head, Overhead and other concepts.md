**Payload:** This is the *actual data* being transmitted, such as a text message, image, or video file.

**Header:** This is *additional information* added to the payload before transmission. It includes metadata details like the sender and receiver addresses, the type of data, and error-checking information.
		
**Overhead:** This refers to the *extra bits* added to the payload for the header. While necessary for reliable data transmission, overhead *can reduce the overall efficiency* of the network.

**Other Related Concepts:**

- **Packet:** A unit of data transmitted over a network. A packet contains: Header and payload 
- **Protocol:** A set of rules governing communication between devices on a network.
- **Bandwidth:** The maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given amount of time.
- **Latency:** The time it takes for data to travel from one point to another on a network.

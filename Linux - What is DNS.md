The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical behind-the-scenes player that keeps the internet running smoothly. It acts like a giant phonebook for the internet, translating easy-to-remember domain names (like [invalid URL removed]) into numerical IP addresses that computers use to connect to each other.

Here's a breakdown of what DNS does:

- **Transforms user-friendly domain names into machine-readable IP addresses:** Imagine trying to call your friend if you only had their phone number memorized as a jumble of digits (like 123-456-7890). IP addresses are similar for computers. DNS translates the familiar names like "[invalid URL removed]" into the corresponding IP address that allows your computer to find the right website.
- **Improves user experience:** Remembering strings of numbers would be a nightmare! DNS makes navigating the internet much easier by allowing us to use memorable names instead of complex IP addresses.
- **Supports various online resources:** DNS isn't just for websites. It also plays a role in email, by directing emails to the right server, and other internet services.
